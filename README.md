# ESPnet light TTS

An unofficial simplified version of ![ESPnet](README_ESPnet.md).

## Targets

    [ ] No installation required
    [ ] Remove dependence on kaldi
    [ ] Keep only the TTS part (Other parts may be added in the future).
    [ ] Remove support for multicomputer distributed systems (Slurm etc.)
    [ ] Remove 'egs' (examples of ESPnet 1)
    [ ] Simplify scripts in 'egs2'

## Progress
There is still a lot of work to be done.


## utils
add following scripts of kaldi as PWG
```
combine_data.sh
